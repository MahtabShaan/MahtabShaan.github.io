# Hello, I’m Mahtab Noor Shaan!

I am an **M.S. graduate in Electrical Engineering** from the **University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH)**. My research focuses on **safe, learning-based control** and **trajectory tracking** for mobile robots under **minimal sensing**, combining **Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)**, **event-triggered control**, and **reinforcement learning**. I build full **ROS2/Gazebo** simulation environments for **lane-keeping** and **collision avoidance**, and validate them on platforms such as **TurtleBot3** and **LIMO**.

Previously, I worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer in Tokyo (2017–2022)**, deploying real-time ML systems and data pipelines with **Python** and **AWS**. Broadly, I’m interested in **safe autonomy**, **robotics**, and **AI for physical systems**.

If you would like to chat or connect, I’d be happy to hear from you!
